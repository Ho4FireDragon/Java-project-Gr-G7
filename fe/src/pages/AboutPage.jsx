                                No where on this list does it mention a veterinarian! To be honest, most veterinarians wouldn’t know what to do with a fish if it came through their door.
                                <a href="#pet-fish">Pet fish</a> are a severely under-served collection of pets. Fish do not receive the same respect as a cat, dog, or horse. Any pet parent has
                                squandered hours trying to find help for a simple problem or severe illness or injury. But what if there was someone who could answer your questions, fix your fish
                                quickly with minimal stress, and prevent it from happening again? Well, here we are.
